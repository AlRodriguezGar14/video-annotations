# Video Annotation Tool

## How to Use

1. **Select a Video**: Choose a video from the dropdown menu populated by the API. (Temporary: You can add videos to the api.json file)
2. **Play the Video**: Use the controls for the video playback.
3. **Add Comments and Drawings**: Write comments and draw directly on the video. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly.
